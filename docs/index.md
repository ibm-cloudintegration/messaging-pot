Within, you will explore a series of hands-on labs designed to give you a high-level understanding of the IBM Messaging solution.

Throughout the labs, you will take on the role of two key persona's:

<span class="label label-developer">Messaging Developer</span>
<span class="label label-administrator">Messaging Administrator</span>

Each section of the guide will identify the persona with which the next few steps relate to, as well as a summary of the tasks you will perform.

Keep an eye out for the tooltips below. These will help guide you through common mistakes, provide tips and helpful context to the task at hand.

The environment that you will be working in today utilizes Blue Demos Cloud to host IBM Messaging.
