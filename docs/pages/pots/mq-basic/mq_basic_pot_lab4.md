# Lab 4 - IBM MQ Security Lab 

## Overview
This lab will demonstrate how to use the Object Authority Manager (**OAM**) component of IBM MQ to manage access to MQ objects such as queues and pub/sub topics.  All of the functions that you will explore in this lab are available via a command line interface as well as the IBM MQ Explorer.  

[View an introduction to IBM MQ Security](https://ibm.box.com/s/vuub0l49uuen837zpr0f31suknobrd8f)

This lab is based on the **Windows 10 x64** VM image.  Start this image, if necessary, and then access the desktop either via the Web or the RDP interface.  Login to Windows with the userid of **ibmdemo** and a password of **passw0rd** (where 0 is numeral zero).

### Userids Used For This Lab 

There are several userids that are pre-defined on your system. You will be using the following userids during this lab exercise:  

| **Userid**   | **Role**                               
|--------------|----------------------------------------
| ibmdemo      | The userid that you used for logging into Windows.  This userid is a member of the **mqm** group.  (Which is the equivalent to a **superuser** in IBM MQ.)
| potuser      | Also a member of the **mqm** group 
| wmbuser      | Not a member of the **mqm** group.  All access to MQ objects must have explicit authority granted to this userid.   
| msgspy       | Not a member of the **mqm** group, however this userid is a member of the local Windows group named **mqusers**.  Access to MQ objects may be granted to either this userid or to the **mqusers** group.  

### Use of RUNAS to Change Runtime Authority 

There are several desktop icons depicting specific users. These shortcut icons use the Windows **runas** command to change the runtime environment to the specified userâ€™s authority.  Using these shortcuts will enable you to test various security settings without having to logoff and re-login as a different user.  

For example, since you have logged into the desktop as **ibmdemo**, if you would like to run a command as a different user you can simply double-click the shortcut for that user. To test this, double-click the **potuser** shortcut.

![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_potuser_Selected.png)

{% include note.html content="If prompted, type in the password for potuser which is **password**." %}

You are now running as user **potuser**.  Use the following command to verify this:

```
echo %USERNAME%
```

![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_potuser_CmdPrompt.png)

{% include important.html content="It will be important to ensure you are using the proper command prompt window as you complete this lab.  Verify the userid that you are currently running as by checking the title bar of the window." %}

Minimize the window for now.  You will use this window later in this lab.  

## Object Authority Manager (OAM) Concepts and Terms

The default configuration for a new IBM MQ queue manager is to utilize the server operating system for authentication, and to use the IBM MQ **Object Authority Manager (OAM)** for enforcing authorization.  You may configure a queue manager to use several alternative options such as an LDAP server, however for this lab you will use the Windows local user and group repository. 

{% include important.html content="Configuration of security is specific to a queue manager.  It is possible to have different security configurations set up for each queue manager when there are multiple queue managers configured on the same server." %}

### Authentication & Authorization

An IBM MQ queue manager may be configured to limit access to MQ resources by verifying the authenticity of users and, once authenticated, verifying their authorization to access MQ objects.  This process is referred to as "Authentication and Authorization".  It is controlled by the properties of the active **Authentication Information (AUTHINFO)** object for the queue manager.       

* **Authentication** is the ability to prove that a user or application is genuinely who that person or what that application claims to be.
* **Authorization** is used to limit what particular individuals or applications can do in your IBM MQ environment.

### Principals and Groups

Authorization to access MQ objects may be defined at the **principal** or **group** level. 

The **OAM** must be able to identify who is requesting access to a particular resource. IBM MQ uses the term **principal** to refer to this identifier. The principal is established when the application first connects to the queue manager; it is determined by the queue manager from the user ID associated with the connecting application.

One or more principals may be added to a **group**.  Also, a principal may be a member of one or more groups.  Determining which mechanism is used to identify which principals are members of which groups is a function of the **AUTHINFO** object properties.  For this lab the queue manager will utilize the Windows local user registry.  

Groups of principals can be granted different types of access authority to the same object. For example, for a specific queue, one group might be allowed to perform both put and get operations; another group might be allowed only to browse the queue ( MQGET with browse option). Similarly, some groups might have put and get authority to a queue, but not be allowed to alter attributes of the queue or delete it. 

### IBM MQ Resources

Authorization checks are performed whenever an application attempts to access an MQ object.  The types of objects that may be protected include: 
 
* Queue Managers
* Queues
* Administrative Topics
* Namelists
* Authentication Information Objects
* Channels
* Listeners
* Services

## Explore OAM Security Options

In order to better understand how the **OAM** is used to protect MQ objects you will work with security for two frequently used functions of IBM MQ: 

1. Point to point messaging with queues
2. Publish and Subscribe messaging

### Setting Up the Lab

Perform the following steps to create a new queue manager with a default configuration.

1. Open a command prompt and use the following commands to create and start a new queue manager.
	
	```
	crtmqm -p 1420 -u SYSTEM.DEAD.LETTER.QUEUE LAB4QM
	strmqm LAB4QM
	```

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Create_QM.png)

2. Next execute the **runmqsc command** to open an MQ command prompt.

	```
	runmqsc LAB4QM
	```

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Runmqsc.png)

3. Execute the following commands to create local queues.

	```
	DEFINE QLOCAL(Q1) REPLACE
	DEFINE QLOCAL(Q2) REPLACE
	```

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Define_QL.png)

4. Execute the following commands to create Administrative Topics.

	```
	DEFINE TOPIC(SPORT) TOPICSTR('sport') REPLACE
	DEFINE TOPIC(SPORT.FOOTBALL) TOPICSTR('sport/football') REPLACE
	DEFINE TOPIC(SPORT.FOOTBALL.PLAYERS) TOPICSTR('sport/football/players') REPLACE
	DEFINE TOPIC(SPORT.FOOTBALL.PLAYERS.HURSLEY) TOPICSTR('sport/football/players/hursley') REPLACE 
	DEFINE TOPIC(SPORT.FOOTBALL.PLAYERS.WINCHESTER) TOPICSTR('sport/football/players/winchester') REPLACE 
	```

   ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Define_Topics.png)

5. You are now ready to begin exploring **OAM** capabilities. Use the mqsc **END** command to exit the **runmqsc** command shell.  Leave the command prompt window open, but minimize it.  Finally, launch the IBM MQ Explorer by clicking on the Windows **Start Menu**, expanding the **IBM MQ** folder and then clicking on the **MQ Explorer (Installation1)** menu item.

   ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Launch_MQExplorer.png)

### Queues

1.  One of the first features that you will review is how a member of the **mqm** group has full access to all commands and MQ objects.  The **potuser** userid is a member of the **mqm** group.  Using the command prompt window for the **potuser** userid, type in the following command: **amqsput Q1 LAB4QM** Type in some text and then press the **Enter** twice to send the message and exit the **amqsput** program. Your message will be stored on the **Q1** queue.

	```
	amqsput Q1 LAB4QM
	```

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Amqsput_Q1.png)

2.  Minimize the command prompt window for the **potuser** userid.  

3.  Find the shortcut for the "runas" **wmbuser** userid and double-click it to open the command prompt window.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_wmbuser_Selected.png)

4.  Run the **amqsput Q1 LAB4QM** command in this command prompt window.  Note that an error is returned.  There are several reasons why the **wmbuser** userid cannot run this program.
	1.  The **wmbuser** userid is not a member of the **mqm** group.  If it were, then it would have access to all of the queue managers and associated objects on this system.
	2. The **wmbuser**, and none of the groups that the **wmbuser** userid is a member of, have been granted explicit authorization to *connect* to the **LAB4QM** queue manager.  Authorization to connect to an individual queue manager is required before a userid can attempt to access any of the objects that are managed by the queue manager.
	3.  Although this error is related to the lack of authority to *connect* to the **LAB4QM** queue manager, there is also a need to enable the **wmbuser** userid, or enable one of the groups that **wmbuser** is a member of, to write messages to the **Q1** queue.  

	    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Amqsput_2035.png)

5. Find the shortcut for the "runas" **msgspy** userid and double-click it to open the command prompt window.  Run the same command and observe the results.  The **msgspy** userid, like the **wmbuser** userid, does not have authorization to connect to the **LAB4QM** queue manager nor access to the **Q1** queue.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Amqsput_Msgspy_2035.png)

6. You will now grant authorization for the **wmbuser** and **msgspy** userids to enable both to *connect* to the **LAB4QM** queue manager and grant authorization to enable both userids to access the **Q1** queue to allow **PUT** operations.  

	{% include note.html content="For the purposes of this lab you will not grant authorization to perform **GET** operations against the **Q1** queue." %}

	There are several methods of administering **OAM** permissions; programmatically, from the command line, or using the MQ Explorer. You will use the MQ Explorer for this lab.  As you complete the following lab steps you will be able to see the equivalent command line commands.   
	
7.  From the MQ Explorer window expand the tree structure to display the **LAB4QM** queue manager.  Right click on the queue manager and then select the **Manage Queue Manager Authority Recordsâ€¦** menu item.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_QM_Auth_Records.png)

8. A window with a list of the currently defined userids that have been granted authorizations to the queue manager is displayed.  Make sure the **Users** tab is active. Click on the **New...** button to open the **New Authorities** window.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_QM_New_Auth.png)

9. Enter **wmbuser** in the **Entity Name:** field and then click on the **Connect** checkbox.   

	{% include note.html content="There are a number of authorization options that can be set using the **OAM**.  Refer to the **setmqaut** command description in the [IBM MQ Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q083500_.htm) for detailed information.  Also, observe the **Command preview** section to see the commands that will be issued. These are the command line equivalent commands that may be used for scripting the configuration of your MQ environment."%}

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Set_QM_Connect_Auth.png)
    
    Click on the **OK** button to continue.

10. A confirmation window will appear.  Click on the **OK** button to close the confirmation window.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Created_OK.png)

11. Confirm that you have added the proper userid.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Add_Connect_Auth.png)

12. For the **msgspy** userid, you will grant **Connect** authorization to the **LAB4QM** queue manager by granting authority to the  **mqusers** group that the **msgspy** userid is a member of.  Repeat the steps to access the **Manage Queue Manager Authority Records...**.  When the **Manage Authority Records** window appears click on the **Groups** tab.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Change_To_Group.png)

13. Repeat the same steps that you performed to add the **wmbuser** to the **Users** tab, only use the **mqusers** group as the **Entity name:**

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Group_Connect.png)

14. Now you need to grant authorization to the **Q1** queue.  From the MQ Explorer window expand the tree structure to display queues associated with the **LAB4QM** queue manager.  Right click on the **Q1** queue and then select the **Manage Authority Recordsâ€¦**.  

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Manage_Recs.png)

15. Expand the **Specific Profiles** folder and then click on the **Q1** queue.  Select the **Users** tab and note that the userid that you have currently logged on with, **ibmdemo** has all authorities to the **Q1** queue.  Click on the **Newâ€¦** button.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Auth_Wmbuser.png)

16. Enter **wmbuser** as the Entity Name and then click on the **Put** checkbox to enable the **wmbuser** userid to perform **PUT** operations against the queue.  Click on the **OK** to save your changes.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Setting_Auth.png)

17. Click on the **OK** button to close the confirmation window.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Created_OK.png)

18. Notice that a user record has been added with **Put** authority for user **wmbuser**. 

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Setmqaut_Q1_Result.png)

19. Now click on the **Groups** tab to enable the **mqusers** group to **PUT** messages to the queue.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Manage_Q1_Groups.png)

20. Enter **mqusers** as the **Entity name:** and then click on the **Put** checkbox to enable all members of the **mqusers** group to perform **PUT** operations against the queue.  Click on the **OK** button to save your changes.  

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Manage_Mqusers.png)

21. Go back to the "runas" command window for the **wmbuser** userid and retry the **amqsput Q1 LAB4QM** command.  This time it should be successful.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Amqsput_wmbuser_OK.png)

22. You gave the user id **wmbuser** the ability to put messages to queues, but not to read or browse messages. In the "runas" **wmbuser** command window enter the following command to attempt to **GET** messages from the queue:

	```
	amqsget Q1 LAB4QM
	```
	
	This will fail with **reason code 2035**, which is a "not authorized" return code.
	
	![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Amqsget_Fail.png)

23. Return to the "runas" window for the **potuser** userid. Try the same command and note that, as a member of the **mqm** group, the **potuser** userid is able to successfully retrieve the messages.  

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Potuser_GET_msgs.png)

24. Return to the "runas" window for the **msgspy** userid.  Try the **amqsput Q1 LAB4QM** command again and note that, even though the **msgspy** userid was not granted access to the queue manager and queue, the userid was able to access these resources due to its membership in the **mqusers** group.  

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Msgspy_OK.png)

There are a number of additional security features that the **OAM** can provide for IBM MQ queue manager queues.  Take a moment to review the various options that are available in the MQ Explorer.  Also, take the time to review the **Command preview** window to see how the various command line options are formatted.  

## Publish and Subscribe Security

IBM MQ supports a topic based publish and subscribe messaging system. One or more applications can act as *publishers* of messages on various topics.  Likewise, one or more applications can act as *subscribers* of messages that have been published to a topic.  IBM MQ can support any number of publishers and subscribers on a given topic.  IBM MQ enables customers to define their own range of topics that they want to support.  

IBM MQ provides the ability to secure how messages are published and subscribed to.  Similar to the authorization support provided for queues, IBM MQ uses the **OAM** to authorize specific userids and/or groups to access a topic.  This is enabled by creating **Administrative Topic** objects in the queue manager.  

This portion of the lab will explore how to use **Administrative Topic** objects to manage authorization to publishing and/or subscribing to MQ topics.

{% include note.html content="**Administrative Topics** can be used to control a number of additional features of publishing and subscribing to messages.  For this lab you will focus only on security.  Refer to the **Publish/subscribe messaging** topic in the [IBM MQ Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.pro.doc/q004870_.htm) for additional information.  Detailed information on security for IBM MQ publish and subscribe may also be found in the **Publish/subscribe security** section of the [IBM MQ Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.sec.doc/q014470_.htm). " %}

1. Start your review of publish/subscribe security by clicking on the **Topics** folder of the **LAB4QM** queue manager and then clicking on the **Show System Objects** button.  You will see a list of the topics that were created at the start of this lab as well as several **SYSTEM** provided topics.  The **SYSTEM.BASE.TOPIC** topic is the root level **Administrative Topic** for all user defined topics in the queue manager.  If an application publishes a message that is not matched by an **Administrative Topic** then the default attributes, *including authorization*, will be applied from this object.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_System_Base_Topic.png)

2. Now, create an *administered*  **Subscription** to capture the messages that you will be publishing.  Right click on the **Subscriptions** folder of the **LAB4QM** queue manager and select the **New** and **Subscription...** menu items.

	{% include note.html content="IBM MQ supports **Administered**, **Managed** and **Unmanaged** subscriptions.  Refer to the \"Writing subscriber applications\" topic in the [IBM MQ Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q026590_.htm) for a description of each type of subscription.  From an **OAM** security perspective, authorization requirements for **Managed** subscriptions are different than **Administered** and **Unmanaged** subscriptions.  You will investigate this later in this lab exercise."  %}

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_New_Subscription.png)

3. Enter **SPORT** in the **Name:** field and then click on the **Next >** button.

    ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Subscription_Name.png)

4. You will want to capture all messages published under the **sport** topic hierarchy.  Enter **sport/#** in the **Topic string:** field, enter **Q2** in the **Destination name:** field and then click the **Finish** button.  Any messages that are successfully published to a topic that includes **sport** at the top level of the topic hierarchy will be sent to the **Q2** queue.

	{% include important.html content="Stop for a moment to consider what you have learned in the **Queues** portion of this lab.  You have configured a static subscription to put messages to the **Q2** queue.
	
	<br />
	<br />
	
	*Will this work?* 
	
	<br />
	<br />
	
	In this case the answer is *yes*, because the **ibmdemo** userid that you used to login to Windows is a member of the **mqm** group, and you created the static subscription under that userid.  Later on you will see that *subscribers* to a topic (that are not members of the **mqm** group) will need to have proper authority to access the queue that their *unmanaged* subscription routes messages to." %}

   ![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Static_Sub_Q2.png)

5. Now try publishing messages from the command prompt windows for the **potuser**, **msgspy** and **wmbuser** userids.  (Recall that **potuser** is a member of the **mqm** group, **msgspy** is a member of the **mqusers** group and **wmbuser** is not in either group).  The command to use is:

	```
	amqspub sport LAB4QM
	```
	
	The **wmbuser** and **msgspy** users received an **mqrc 2035** error, which is related to not having authorization.  The **potuser**, on the other hand, was able to successfully publish a message.

	![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_2035_Error.png)

	{% include important.html content="Again, stop to consider what you had learned in the **Queues** portion of this lab.  Is the error due to the lack of authorization to the **LAB4QM** queue manager, *or* is it due to a lack of authorization to the **sport** topic? 
	
	<br />
	<br />
	 
	*In this case, the userids had previously been granted access to the **LAB4QM** queue manager.  When the **amqspub** application first attempted to open the topic to PUBLISH a message the **OAM** checked the topic hierarchy for authorization.  Since you haven't granted any authorization against the **SPORT** Administrative Topic, the queue manager checked the next level in the hierarchy, which was the **SYSTEM.BASE.TOPIC**.  Since there are no authorizations granted at that level, only userids that are members of the **mqm** group are allowed to publish to the topic.*" %}
 
6. Grant authorization to the **SPORT.FOOTBALL** Administrative Topic for the **mqusers** group.  Start by right clicking on the topic and then selecting the **Object Authorities** and **Manage Authority Records...** menu items.

	![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Football_Authority.png)

7. Expand the **Specific Profiles** folder, click on the **SPORT.FOOTBALL** Administrative Topic and then select the **Groups** tab.  Click on the **New...** button to add the **mqusers** group.

	![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Group_Authorization.png)

8. Enter **mqusers** in the **Entity name:** field and then click on the **Publish** and **Subscribe** checkboxes.  Observe the **Command preview** to see the commands that will be execute and then click on the **OK** button.

	![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Mqusers_Publish.png)

9. Clear the confirmation window and close the **Manage Authority Records** window.  Retry the command to publish a message to the **sport** topic for each of the userids.  Notice that they behave as before.  This isn't surprising, since you granted authorities at a lower level in the hierarchy.

	```
	amqspub sport LAB4QM
	```

10. Retry publishing messages for each userid at the level of the hierarchy where you granted authorization to publish to the members of the **mqusers** group.  Use the following command:

	```
	amqsput sport/football LAB4QM
	```
	
11. This time the **msgspy** and **potuser** userids were able to publish a message.  The **msgspy** userid had authorization due to it being a member of the **mqusers** group and the **potuser** userid had authorization due to it being a member of the **mqm** group. 

	Now, try adding an authorization at a lower level in the hierarchy for the **wmbuser** userid.  Follow the same steps as before to add a *user* authorization to publish messages on the **SPORT.FOOTBALL.PLAYERS.HURSLEY** Administrative Topic for the **wmbuser** userid. 

	![](./images/pots/mq/lab4/Security_Wmbuser_Hursley.png)

12. Retry publishing messages for each userid on the **sport/football/players/hursley** topic using the following command:

	```
	amqsput sport/football/players/hursley LAB4QM
	```
	
13. *Are you surprised at the results?*  All three userids are able to publish messages on the **sport/football/players/hursley** topic.  The reason is:

	| **Userid**   | **Reason Why It Can or Can't Publish**
	|--------------|----------------------------------------
	| potuser      | Authorization was granted since the **potuser** userid is a member of the **mqm** group.
	| wmbuser      | Authorization was granted via the **SPORT.FOOTBALL.PLAYERS.HURSLEY** Administrative Topic you had just defined.
	| msgspy       | The queue manager will check for a matching Administrative Topic at the current topic level to see if authorization is granted.  It will then check each successive parent Administrative Topic object until an authorization is found.  If no authorization is found then authorization will be based on the **SYSTEM.BASE.TOPIC** Administrative Topic object.  In this case, since the **msgspy** userid is a member of the **mqusers** group, and the **mqusers** group has **Publish** authority on the **SPORT.FOOTBALL** Administrative Topic, authorization to publish was granted.  

14. Now try publishing a message on the **sport/football/players/winchester** topic.  Use the following command for each userid:

	```
	amqspub sport/football/players/winchester LAB4QM
	```

15. It should come as no surprise that the **msgspy** and **potuser** userids were able to publish, but the **wmbuser** userid was not able to.

16. Now, try to guess what will happen if you attempt to publish a message when there isn't an Administrative Topic defined for the topic you are publishing to.  Try publishing the following message using each of the userids:
	
	```
	amqspub sport/football/players/liverpool LAB4QM
	```
	  
17. *Were you able to predict the behavior?*  Only the **msgspy** and **potuser** userids were able to publish messages on the **sport/football/players/liverpool** topic.  The reason is:

	| **Userid**   | **Reason Why It Can or Can't Publish**
	|--------------|----------------------------------------
	| potuser      | Authorization was granted since the **potuser** userid is a member of the **mqm** group.
	| wmbuser      | Authorization was *not* granted.  You haven't defined an Administrative Topic for the **sport/football/players/liverpool** topic hierarchy.  When the queue manager completed its checks of each parent Administrative Topic in the hierarchy it was not able to find any authorization for **wmbuser**, or any of the groups it is a member of.
	| msgspy       | You haven't defined an Administrative Topic for the **sport/football/players/liverpool** topic, however the queue manager was able to traverse the topic hierarchy and it located the **SPORT.FOOTBALL** Administrative Topic where members of the **mqusers** group have **Publish** authorization defined.  Thus, the **msgspy** userid was able to publish the message.  

18. Up to this point in the lab you have been working with Administrative Topics to manage the authorization of applications to *publish* messages.  Managing authorizations to *subscribe* to topics follows the same principals for **Managed** subscriptions.  You may verify this by using a sample application to *subscribe* to a topic from one of the command prompt windows while using a different command prompt window to *publish* messages.  The sample subscriber application is **amqssub**.  The syntax is the same as the **amqspub** application.  Try using the following test combinations to see how **OAM** security works for the *subscribing* application.

	**(P1) Command**
	
	```
	amqspub sport/football LAB4QM
	```
	
	**(P2) Command**
	
	```
	amqspub sport/football/players/hursley LAB4QM
	```
	
	**(P3) Command**
	
	```
	amqspub sport/football/players/liverpool LAB4QM
	```
	
	**(S1) Command**
	
	```
	amqssub sport/football LAB4QM
	```
	
	**(S2) Command**
	
	```
	amqssub sport/football/players/hursley LAB4QM
	```
	
	**(S3) Command**
	
	```
	amqssub sport/football/players/liverpool LAB4QM
	```
	
	**Tests**

	{% include important.html content="*Are you puzzled by the results?*  You were able to use the **wmbuser** userid to access the **sport/football/players/hursley** topic before.  
	
	<br />
	
	If you recall, when you added the authorization for the **wmbuser** userid to access the **sport/football/players/hursley** topic you only added **Publish** authorization. You need to also include **Subscribe** authorization for the second test to have enabled the **wmbuser** userid to successfully subscribe.  The **msgspy** userid is able to subscribe since the **mqusers** group that was added to the **SPORT.FOOTBALL** Administrative Topic was given both **Publish** and **Subscribe** authorization when you added authorization to it." %}
  
19. There is one final point to consider when you are evaluating **OAM** security for publish and subscribe authorization.  The tests you did in the previous lab step were all using **Managed Subscriptions**.  That is, you allowed the queue manager to dynamically manage the storage of the messages as they went from the *publishing* application to the *subscribing* application.  

	**Administered** and **Unmanaged** subscriptions are different in that the MQ administrator or the application developer specify where the messages will be stored when they are delivered.  At the start of this section of the lab you specified that all messages that matched the **sport/#** topic would be stored in the **Q2** queue.  Any application that wants to consume the messages from that queue will need to have **OAM** authorization to **GET** messages from that queue.  If you write an application that creates an **Unmanaged Subscription**, then the userid that the application is running under would need authorization to *both* the topic and the queue that messages will be delivered to.
