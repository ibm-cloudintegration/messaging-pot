# Lab Environment 

If you are running this lab as part of a PoT event, the instructor will provide a URL for you to access a Skytap environment. Open a browser and navigate to the URL which will open the Skytap environment. 

If you are running this lab independent of an event, click this link to reserve a demo which will provision a Skytap environment.

You can pause each VM or the environment at any time. The stop button will shutdown the VM(s). You should not need to stop the VMs while doing this lab.
