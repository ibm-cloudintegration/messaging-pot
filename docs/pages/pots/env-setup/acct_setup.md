You should have already received a URL from the instructor. Open a browser and navigate to the URL which will open a Skytap environment. The Skytap lab environment for the PoT is shown below. There are three VMware images - one Windows 10, one Ubuntu Linux, and one virtual MQ Appliance. 

Click the run button as shown below to start the environment.

The control buttons are highlighted for each VM as well as the overall environment. You should have already started the environment by clicking the run button. You can pause each VM or the environment at any time. The stop button will shutdown the VM(s). You should not need to stop the VMs while doing this lab.

Once the VMs are powered up and ready, the icons turn green and show Running. To open a console for either VM, click the monitor icon and a new browser window will open with the Windows desktop or the MQ Appliance command line.
