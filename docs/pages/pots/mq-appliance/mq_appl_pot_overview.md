# IBM MQ Appliance Proof of Technology Overview

This guide and associated VMware images help you get started with IBMÂ® MQ Appliance V9.2.4.  

# Introduction

The IBM MQ Appliance provides a simplified messaging solution by
combining many of the benefits of IBM MQ with those of a physical
appliance. Like IBM MQ, the IBM MQ Appliance provides a rapid, reliable,
security-rich infrastructure, but unlike IBM MQ, it combines software
with hardware. Deployable in less than 30 minutes, the IBM MQ Appliance
saves customers from having to build their own servers, or needing
extensive local MQ expertise when they deploy to partners or remote
locations.

The IBM MQ Appliance has the following benefits:

*  Seamless integration: integrates with existing MQ networks and
    clusters

*   Simple, out-of-the-box High Availability: with paired connectivity
    to another appliance, delivering personalized role-based monitoring
    and configuration

*   Simple, out-of-the-box Disaster Recovery: with flexible topologies
    and use cases making adding DR easy

*   MQ Console: a browser-based user interface, offering personalized
    role-based monitoring and configuration

*   Simpler maintenance: fix packs delivered as certified firmware
    updates onto a locked-down appliance

*   Maximum performance out-of-the-box: pre-optimized with no tuning or
    additional configuration needed

Customers can choose between two appliances, according to the needs of
their business:

*   IBM MQ Appliance M2002A: A high-end solution for enterprise use

*   IBM MQ Appliance M2002B: Lower-end solution for smaller needs or great for branch office or
    factory deployment

### Audience

This session is specifically designed for IT Professionals such as
system architects, system designers and managers who are looking for a
solution to satisfy their enterprise messaging and data movement
requirements. No detailed knowledge of IBM software is required.
However, it is recommended that participants have an understanding of
their business needs concerning messaging and data movement. A basic
understanding of IBM MQ is also assumed.
